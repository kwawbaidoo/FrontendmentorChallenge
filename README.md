## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

As a beginner I have learnt a lot from this project. I have previously read about the semantic HTML5,
and practical i have been able to codeto see the output.
The use of *classes and IDs* seems like magic when trying to style elements.
Also, how to import image in the *img tag* was a little difficult but I was able to go through it.
Use of *flexbox* was awesome and ready to learn more of it and also *CSS Grid*.
Am ready to *learn, un-learn and relearn* from experiece engineers and collegues.


```html
<img scr="It makes importing of images simple" alt="">

```
```css
.codediv {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```


### Continued development

In the future projecct, will like to learn more on how to use *flexbox and CSS Grid* and *CSS* as a whole to get more
concept before trying to move to javascript.


### Useful resources

- [Font](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap) - This helped me for getting the font mean to be used for the project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [EasyLearning](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing site which helped me to understand
what i was doing. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
